# Overview
The idea behind Storybox is to do a ground up [interactive fiction] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) engine.

For a really geeky deep dive see the documentary [Get Lamp] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRhbcDzbGSU)

# Interface
Ideally we'll be able to produce an interface similar to [PlanetFall] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetfall), [Galatea](http://iplayif.com/?story=http://parchment.toolness.com/if-archive/games/zcode/Galatea.zblorb.js), [Amnesia] (http://www.old-games.com/download/1200/amnesia), and [Hitchhiker's Guide] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game_nolan.shtml).

# Complexity and Scope
Progressing through the game will be something like a choose your own adventure with no branching.

* Commands: A basic set of commands -> open, close, get, put, fight, talk

* Narrative Items: These are items which only return more narrative for supported commands.

* Trigger Items: Interacting with these items might progress the story for better or worse.

# Personal Goal(s)
I tried to write a novel once and it turns out I really don't have the fingers for it. I like the creative process of writing and world building though. I also tried to write a few games and really don't have the time. Interactive fiction feels like the right mix of a couple interests (critical thinking, code, and creative writing). Being able to add variable length through exploration is also really appealing.

tl;dr - It would be cool to write IF that can be consumed in as little as 45 minutes or as long as 2 hours.
