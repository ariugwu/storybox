# Overview
The idea behind Storybox is to do a ground up [interactive fiction] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction).

# Interface
Ideally we'll be able to produce an interface similar to [PlanetFall] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetfall).

# Complexity and Scope
Progressing through the game will be something like a choose your own adventure with no branching.

* Commands: A basic set of commands -> open, close, get, put, fight, talk

* Narrative Items: These are items which only return more narrative for supported commands.

* Trigger Items: Interacting with these items might progress the story for better or worse.
